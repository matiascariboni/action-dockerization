# üöÄ Dockerization GitHub Action

This composite GitHub Action simplifies and automates the Dockerization process for your CI/CD workflows. It dynamically determines the Docker image tag, selects the appropriate Dockerfile, formats ports and networks for Docker Compose, and builds your image using Buildx with support for multiple architectures and layer caching.

---

## üîß What It Does

This action performs the following tasks:

1. **Detects whether the push is a tag or a branch**
   ‚Üí If it's a tag: uses the tag name as Docker tag.
   ‚Üí If it's a branch: uses the short commit hash as Docker tag.

2. **Resolves the appropriate Dockerfile** based on environment name:
   - If a file named `Dockerfile.<environment>` exists (e.g., `Dockerfile.dev`), it uses that.
   - Otherwise, it falls back to the default `Dockerfile`.

3. **Generates the Docker Compose file name** using the repository name and environment.

4. **Extracts and formats ports** from the Dockerfile for Compose using custom comment syntax like:
   ```Dockerfile
   EXPOSE 3000
   # TO 80
   ```
   ‚û§ This will map `3000` to `80` in Compose.

5. **Parses networks** from comments like:
   ```Dockerfile
   # NETWORK my-network
   ```

6. **Parses volumes** from comments like:
   ```Dockerfile
   # VOLUME /data:/app/data
   ```

7. **Builds the Docker image** with `buildx`, using the correct tag, Dockerfile, platform(s), and **optional layer caching** for faster builds.

## üìÅ Required Files in Your Repository

Your repository must contain:

- ‚úÖ A `Dockerfile` (default) **or** a `Dockerfile.<env_name>` matching the current Git ref.
- ‚úÖ A valid Git structure to differentiate between environments and tags.
- üîÑ You don't need to include any Compose file ‚Äî the filename is only generated and exposed as output in case it's useful in later workflow steps (e.g., for deployment scripts).

## üß™ Example Usage

### Basic Usage (Without Cache)

```yaml
jobs:
  dockerize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Dockerization
        id: dockerization
        uses: matiascariboni/action-dockerization@v1.0.4
        with:
          IMAGE_ARCH: linux/amd64
          COMPOSE_NAME: my-app
          ENV_NAME: production

      - name: Print results
        run: |
          echo "Image: ${{ steps.dockerization.outputs.IMAGE_NAME }}"
          echo "Compose file: ${{ steps.dockerization.outputs.COMPOSE_FILE_NAME }}"
          echo "Ports: ${{ steps.dockerization.outputs.COMPOSE_PORTS }}"
          echo "Networks: ${{ steps.dockerization.outputs.COMPOSE_NETWORKS }}"
```

### Advanced Usage (With Layer Caching)

For faster builds, enable Docker layer caching by using GitHub Actions cache:

```yaml
jobs:
  dockerize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Cache Docker layers
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: /tmp/.buildx-cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-${{ github.sha }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-

      - name: Dockerization with cache
        id: dockerization
        uses: matiascariboni/action-dockerization@v1.0.4
        with:
          IMAGE_ARCH: linux/arm64
          COMPOSE_NAME: my-app
          ENV_NAME: production
          CACHE_FROM: type=local,src=/tmp/.buildx-cache
          CACHE_TO: type=local,dest=/tmp/.buildx-cache-new,mode=max

      - name: Move Docker cache
        if: always()
        run: |
          if [ -d "/tmp/.buildx-cache-new" ]; then
            rm -rf /tmp/.buildx-cache
            mv /tmp/.buildx-cache-new /tmp/.buildx-cache
          fi

      - name: Print results
        run: |
          echo "Image: ${{ steps.dockerization.outputs.IMAGE_NAME }}"
```

### Multi-Architecture Build

```yaml
- name: Dockerization (multi-arch)
  uses: matiascariboni/action-dockerization@v1.0.4
  with:
    IMAGE_ARCH: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
    COMPOSE_NAME: my-app
    ENV_NAME: production
```

## üéØ Dockerfile Comment Syntax

This action uses special comments in your Dockerfile to extract metadata for Docker Compose:

### Port Mapping

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 3000
# TO 80
```

This will generate: `80:3000` in the Compose ports section.

### Network Assignment

```Dockerfile
# NETWORK my-network
```

This will assign the container to `my-network` in Compose.

### Volume Mapping

```Dockerfile
# VOLUME /host/path:/container/path
```

This will create a volume mapping in Compose.

## üöÄ Performance Benefits

Using the `CACHE_FROM` and `CACHE_TO` inputs can significantly reduce build times:

- **Without cache**: Full rebuild on every push (~10-15 minutes for Node.js apps)
- **With cache**: Only changed layers rebuild (~2-5 minutes for code changes)

### Cache Savings Example:

```
Scenario 1: Code change (no dependency changes)
‚îú‚îÄ npm ci layer:      ‚úÖ CACHED (saves 5-7 minutes)
‚îú‚îÄ Build layer:       ‚ùå Rebuilt (necessary)
‚îî‚îÄ Total time:        ~3 minutes (instead of 10+)

Scenario 2: Dependency change
‚îú‚îÄ npm ci layer:      ‚ùå Rebuilt (necessary)
‚îú‚îÄ Build layer:       ‚ùå Rebuilt (necessary)
‚îî‚îÄ Total time:        ~10 minutes
```
