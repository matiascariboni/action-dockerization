# üöÄ Dockerization GitHub Action

This composite GitHub Action simplifies and automates the Dockerization process for your CI/CD workflows. It dynamically determines the Docker image tag, selects the appropriate Dockerfile, formats ports and networks for Docker Compose, and builds your image using Buildx with support for multiple architectures.

---

## üîß What It Does

This action performs the following tasks:

1. **Detects whether the push is a tag or a branch**\
   ‚Üí If it's a tag: uses the tag name as Docker tag.\
   ‚Üí If it's a branch: uses the short commit hash as Docker tag.

2. **Resolves the appropriate Dockerfile** based on environment name:

   - If a file named `Dockerfile.<environment>` exists (e.g., `Dockerfile.dev`), it uses that.
   - Otherwise, it falls back to the default `Dockerfile`.

3. **Generates the Docker Compose file name** using the repository name and environment.

4. **Extracts and formats ports** from the Dockerfile for Compose using custom comment syntax like:

   ```Dockerfile
   EXPOSE 3000
   # TO 80
   ```

   ‚û§ This will map `3000` to `80` in Compose.

5. **Parses networks** from comments like:

   ```Dockerfile
   # NETWORK my-network
   ```

6. **Builds the Docker image** with `buildx`, using the correct tag, Dockerfile, and platform(s).

## üìÅ Required Files in Your Repository

Your repository must contain:

- ‚úÖ A `Dockerfile` (default) **or** a `Dockerfile.<env_name>` matching the current Git ref.
- ‚úÖ A valid Git structure to differentiate between environments and tags.
- üîÑ You don't need to include any Compose file ‚Äî the filename is only generated and exposed as output in case it's useful in later workflow steps (e.g., for deployment scripts).

      - name: Dockerization
        id: dockerization
        uses: matiascariboni/action-dockerization@v1.0.1
        with:
          IMAGE_ARCH: linux/amd64

      - name: Print results
        run: |
          echo "Image: ${{ steps.dockerization.outputs.IMAGE_NAME }}"
