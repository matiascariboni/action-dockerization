# üê≥ Dockerization

This GitHub Composite Action automates Docker-related configuration steps in your CI/CD workflows. It is designed to simplify and standardize Docker image tagging, Dockerfile selection, port and network parsing, and image building using `buildx`.

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ Automatically determines the correct Docker tag from Git branches or Git tags
- ‚úÖ Dynamically selects the appropriate `Dockerfile` based on branch name
- ‚úÖ Extracts port mappings and network configuration hints from comments inside `Dockerfile`
- ‚úÖ Uses `docker/setup-qemu-action` and `docker/setup-buildx-action` to support cross-platform builds
- ‚úÖ Builds Docker image using `docker/build-push-action`
- ‚úÖ Outputs useful deployment metadata like image name, Docker tag, Dockerfile path, and more
